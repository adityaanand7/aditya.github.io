      <description>Hello! I am a PhD Research Scholar in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay working with Dr. Manas Thakur. I work in the area of compiler optimizations and program analysis. Currently I am working to design a precise and efficient static+dynamic program analysis technique for Java&amp;rsquo;s JIT compiler.
