      <description>In languages like Java where garbage collector (GC) is used for cleaning up the unused references. The idea of write barriers is used at runtime to communicate with GC for letting the GC know the set of objects that needs to be tracked due to object pointers getting stored in another object and classes.&#xA;The JIT compiler is required to insert a write barrier in the code which it generates to maintain the function correctness.</description>

      <description>Hello! I am a PhD Research Scholar in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay working with Dr. Manas Thakur. I work in the area of compiler optimizations and program analysis. Currently I am working to design a speculative static+dynamic program analysis technique for Java&amp;rsquo;s JIT compiler.&#xA;Professional Service Artifact Evaluation Committee Member: Programming Language Design and Implementation PLDI 2024 European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming ECOOP 2024 Academic Experience Teaching Assistant (CS6004: Code Optimization for Object-Oriented Languages), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Spring 2024.</description>
